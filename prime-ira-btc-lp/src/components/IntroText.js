              Self-directed IRAs offer a great way for investors to contribute
              to the crowdfunding space including start-up ventures, business
              expansions, and other ground floor opportunities. In the past,
              only those who are accredited investors with proven financial
              security could acquire private stock and equity opportunities
              through crowdfunding. With new regulations in place, all investors
              have the opportunity to take advantage of crowdfunding
              investments.
